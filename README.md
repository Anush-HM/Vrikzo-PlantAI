## 🔐 Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`PORT=5000` \
`MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string` \
`GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key` \
`OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key` \
`EMAIL_USER=your_email_address` \
`EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password` 

The application requires a valid MongoDB Atlas connection to run.

## 🗄️ Database Setup

This project uses MongoDB Atlas as its primary database.
- The database schema and collections are defined using Mongoose models in the codebase
- No manual database or collection creation is required
- Collections are automatically created when the application runs and data is inserted

MongoDB Setup Steps:
1.  Create a cluster on MongoDB Atlas
2. Copy the cluster connection string
3. Add the connection string to the MONGODB_URI environment variable
4. Whitelist your IP address in Atlas network access settings
